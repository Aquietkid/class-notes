# The Client-Server Architecture
In a client-server architecture, there are two modules: client module and server module. 
- client module is designed for the end-user and their devices, and provides user-friendly interfaces. 
- the server module handles storage, retrieval, and searching of data besides other functions. 
# Data Models
Database systems provide __data abstraction__: the hiding of implementation-level details and highlighting of important details. This allows for a better understanding of the data. There are three types of data models: 
- High-level (conceptual) data models: represent data as it is perceived by the end-user
- Low-level (physical) data models: represent data as it is stored on storage media
- Representational (implementation) models: an intermediate representation between high and low-level data models. 
## Schema 
The description of a database is called the __database schema__, which is specified during database design and is not expected to change frequently. It can be drawn into a __schema diagram__. An object (table or relation) in the schema is referred to as a __schema construct__.
