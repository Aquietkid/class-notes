An associative entity is the combination of a relation and an entity. 

An entity has specific attributes whereas a relation connects one or more entity-types. To combine the effects of both, we end up with a relation that has attributes, or rather, an entity which connects one or more other entity-types. 

- shown using rounded rectangle, or a rectangle containing a diamond
- used when a many-to-many relation between one or more entities is further related to another entity. 

An associative entity is, in some ways, like a weak entity. The actual existence of the associative entity is somewhat dependent on the existence of the related entities. Similarly, weak entities can only exist when the related entities exist
## Similarities
- both can exist only when the related entities also exist
- instances of both are deleted upon deletion of the instances of the related entities
