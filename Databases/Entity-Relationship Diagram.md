- Partial participation: instances may be involved in other relations. 
- Total Participation: instances are only involved in a specific relation. 
# Specialization
Based on some common attributes, entity sub-types are defined. 
- Total specialization: all sub-classes defined
- Partial specialization: some instances may not belong to any of the defined subclasses. 
# Hierarchy
Multiple levels of specialization
# Lattice
Multiple inheritance. Shared subclasses. 
# Categories (Union Types)
Based on a common role in the miniworld, different entity types are grouped (or union-ed) together to create a single relation.
