- IR1 (reflexive rule): If $X ⊇ Y$, then $X →Y$.
- IR2 (augmentation rule): ${X → Y} |=XZ → YZ$.
- IR3 (transitive rule): ${X → Y, Y → Z} |=X → Z$.
- IR4 (decomposition, or projective, rule): ${X → YZ} |=X → Y$.
- IR5 (union, or additive, rule): ${X → Y, X → Z} |=X → YZ$.
- IR6 (pseudotransitive rule): ${X → Y, WY → Z} |=WX → Z$. ^8de335
